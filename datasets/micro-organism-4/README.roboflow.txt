It includes 859 images.
Micro-organism are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -20 and +20 degrees
* Random shear of between -20째 to +20째 horizontally and -20째 to +20째 vertically
